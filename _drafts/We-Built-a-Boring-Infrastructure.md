In October, I'm coming up on six years at Stack Overflow. I've spent a bit of time recently thinking back over everything I've done here. And the one major realization I came to is that we built a boring infrastructure and I'm **INCREDIBLY PROUD** of that. No really. I am. We deal with a very simple architecture to run a very large site.
