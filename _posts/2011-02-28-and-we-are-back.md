After about a year off from writing on a personal blog, i've decided that I should really do this things again - for reals this time.  Being inspired by the writing I'm doing for my job, and the fact I'm actually missing doing this - along with about 30,000 things i've been thinking about and keep saying "I need to write this down somewhere." I've finally decided to jump back into the fray.

This is probably my third or fourth time i've gone around this loop, writing, not writing. And amazingly through everything my domain has always been available to me.

I'll be taking the next few days/weeks to get the blog to a state that makes me happy, as well as to start to just write.

And really this is placeholder text so there isn't a 404 on the front page.
