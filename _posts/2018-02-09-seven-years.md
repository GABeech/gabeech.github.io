About Seven years ago I started at Stack Overflow. Today, with mixed emotions I am leaving Stack Overflow for my next adventure. I am both sad to leave a great company, and great people. At the same time, I am excited to take on a new and bigger challenge. I donâ€™t know where my career or my life would be at right now if I had not come to Stack Overflow to make the internet a better place. The amount that I have learned from my coworkers is astounding, these really are some of the smartest and best people I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I will carry the memories, and the mission of Stack Overflow with me for the rest of my life. On Monday, I will start my next adventure with Take Two Interactive.
