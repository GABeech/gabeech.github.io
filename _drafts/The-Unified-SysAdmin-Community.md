Ever since I started working at Stack Exchange, I've been thinking about the topic of community more and more. Well, that's not quite true I've thought off and on over probably my whole career. When I was a young baby sysadmin I really wanted the ability to find a place to go and hang out, learn from the wiser more seasoned sysadmins. As I grew into my powers I would have loved to have a community I could talk thing over with, mull problems, meet up and go out for a beer. Now, I know some of you are going to say "IRC! FTW" which, is a semi-valid answer. The problem with IRC -as I see it - is that it is not really a group of sysadmins, it's a group of specific sysadmins (I'll go more into this later).

My recent focus on the SysAdmin community really shouldn't come as a surprise since Stack Exchange is all about building communities. What has really bothered me when thinking about these topics is that there doesn't seem to be a Sysadmin community at large. For the most part we don't self identify as just "SysAdmins" we self identify as "Windows Admins", "Linux Admins", "Unix Admins", "Web Operations Admins." As a community we have fractured, we have splintered to the point that it makes it hard to share information, ideas, war stories across these boundaries.

There are many great organization out there trying to create this sense of community. I work for one of them (Stack Exchange) and I highly support another (LOPSA). While they do great work, there is a disconnect that I think is going to make things really hard to get a real, strong, vibrant community going that goes back to the early days of Systems Administration.

Part 1: The OS Wars

For as long as there have been SysAdmins there have been religous wars going on over which Operating System is superior. Windows vs. Linux vs. BSD vs. Netware vs. `insert OS here`. These wars have fractured our community, which is probably one of the smaller IT professions probably only beaten by Networking and Telecom folks. I've been a Windows Admin just as long as I've been a Linux Admin, the interesting thing to notice is when you tell someone from the *nix camp you are a windows admin they give you a look of sadness, and sympathly. Then, they promptly tell you just how bad your choice of specialty has been, how much more SUPERIOR the Linux way of doing things is, how you should really give up windows and never look back. Well guess what having to sit through this is demoralizing, frustrating and just plain sucks.
