I had a great - albeit brief - conversation with Matt Simmons while he was in town on his [world tour in NYC](http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/2012/01/manhattan-world-tour-1-night-only-wednesday-212012/ "world tour") recently that got me thinking about bringing the SysAdmin community together.

This isn't the first time that I've thought about how bring the SysAdmin community together in a stronger way. And, since I've joined [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com) I've thought about it more and more since community building is a big part of what we do here. The working theories are that there are a large portion of our community in the small business sector - places like regional ISPs that have a large need for administrators, but aren't that big in the grand scheme of things. But it _seems_ that a good deal of system administrators aren't involved in the community at all - or at least not in a visible way. There are a few questions that come to mind when you start to think about how to grow and solidify a community:

* How do I reach these people
* How do I get them involved The problem I'm having now, is simply I don't really have any ideas on how to accomplish these goals, how to reach out and bring people into the wonderful community that is being built. I shall keep mulling this over, but if you have any ideas - leave them in the comments below.
