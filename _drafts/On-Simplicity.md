## Simplicity

A simple word, that seems to be harder to find in the IT field. Every day I hear about new fads, and current fads that I _just have to_ start using. This statement is generally followed by a long primer on why something is the next best thing since sliced bread.

It actually concerns me greatly that as an industry we have decided to opt - for the most part - to build massive systems of many small parts.
