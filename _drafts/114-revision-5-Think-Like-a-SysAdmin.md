<p>Many people hold the idea that all Systems Administrators are BOFH's. That is, arrogant, anti-social blow-hards that don't ever want to help you and seem to take joy in your pain. There are some out there that give us a bad name, but for the most part Systems Administrators are great people. I think that a lot of these misconceptions that people have in their heads about the general attitude of a sysadmin is due to an imperfect understanding of our job, and what really goes into what we do.</p>

<p>We really have multiple job duties and responsibilities that we need to have as part of our skills arsenal to be really good. And, honestly not all of them are as fun as building out an infrastructure - or in other words solving fun technical problems. Some of these things really, really suck and of course are the parts of our job that people identify most with, and remember.</p>

<p>Because we all like lists - here are a few areas that the sysadmins have to know about, or at least be aware of while working:</p>

<ul>
<li>Network Configuration</li>
<li>Systems Configuration</li>
<li>Application Configuration</li>
<li>Coding </li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Risk-Management</li>
<li>Finance (we spend a LOT of money) </li>
<li>Corporate Policy (and I'm not talking about just signing off we need to actually <em>know</em> a lot of this stuff) </li>
<li>Facilities Operation</li>
<li>Electrical Design Principals</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a good deal of stuff there, and honestly I probably could have kept going but I didn't want this post to get too long. Before I get too far into describing some of these things I'd like to say 1) I'm not making excuses for the behavior of some in our profession and 2) Depending on where you work this list could be longer or shorter but at some point in your career you'll interact with some or all of these items.</p>

<h2>The Core Skills</h2>

<p>Network configuration, systems configuration, application configuration, and coding - these are the core skills that every sysadmin has, heck it's the reason we got into the profession. This is the fun part of our job, what makes up wake up in the morning and be ready for another day of work. These are the reasons we get hired, stay hired, and well get woken up at 3am!</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Every one of us needs to consider the security of the systems we design and deploy. We also have to comply with an ever expanding list of certifications, and laws: HIPPA, PCI, SOX to name a few. Some places you'll have a dedicated IT security person who handles dealing with auditors, documenting compliance, and all of that really boring stuff BUT the sysadmins still need to implement and be part of enforcement.  If there isn't a dedicated security person, generally the sysadmin is the one doing all of the work.</p>

<p>The worst part of this is the enforcement part, we have to be the bad guys the guys saying no you can't do <thing you really want to do>. Imagine having this conversion 10, 20, 30 or more times a year:</p>

<p>Person A: Hey, I can't seem to get to File Share xyz, and I need a spreadsheet on there with information my boss needs me to summarize by 5pm today!
Sysadmin: Sure, I just need you to file a ticket and have your boss sign off on the permission change. 
Person A: Can't you just do it? Why do I need to have my boss sign off!?
Sysadmin: Because we are required by <Cert ABC> to document all permission changes and have a sign-off
Person A: Well, can't you help me out just this once? You can remove it after I grab the file. 
Sysadmin: I really can't do that, you need to put a ticket in. 
Person A: Fine!</p>
